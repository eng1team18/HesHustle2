Welcome to Heslington! You are a student at the University of York and your first big exam is fast approaching, but you haven't studied yet at all! Over the next 7 days you will need to make sure you study once per day, eat breakfast lunch and dinner, complete a variety of recreational activities per day, and get enough sleep.
You can look around Campus East for activities, or even get the bus into city centre for more!
