# Heslington Hustle Group 18

### Running the game
You can run the game by using
`java -jar jar-file-HesHustle.jar` or double clicking the JAR file. Make sure you extract the .zip file before running!

Please ensure the game has permissions to create files, as the game must create a leaderboard.json file in the directory at the end of the game if there is not already one.
